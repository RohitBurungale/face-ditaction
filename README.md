# face-ditaction
A simple real-time face detection project built with Python and OpenCV. It uses a Haar Cascade model to detect faces from a webcam feed and draws bounding boxes around them. Easy to set up, lightweight, and great for beginners exploring computer vision or building basic detection features.

## Face Detection using Python and OpenCV

This project is a quick and lightweight face detection tool built with Python and OpenCV. It uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade model to identify faces in real time through a webcam. The goal is to provide an easy starting point for anyone learning computer vision or experimenting with basic detection systems.

### Features

* Real-time face detection
* Simple and clean Python script
* Uses OpenCV’s built-in Haar Cascade model
* Draws bounding boxes around detected faces
* Runs on any system with a webcam

### How It Works

The script reads frames from the webcam, converts them to grayscale, and applies OpenCV’s face detection model. When a face is found, it highlights it with a rectangle.

### Setup

Install the required library:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

Run the script:

```bash
python face_detect.py
```

Press **q** to close the window.

### File Included

* `face_detect.py` → Main script for running face detection.

### Future Improvements

* Add face recognition
* Improve accuracy using DNN models
* Build a GUI for easy control
* Add screenshot or face capture feature
